An international network of researchers, practitioners and policymakers using plant translocations to address biodiversity loss.

# Current activities
 1. Building a diverse global membership (see <a href="#membership" title="Membership">below</a> for current members and judge for yourself how geographically diverse we are - we're still very underepresented in South America, Asia and Africa);
 2. Developing a meeting proposal: *Plant translocation and climate change: bioassay, surveillance and solution to a global threat?*;
 3. Exploring the potential for review papers, special issues and practice-relevant publications to develop science and practice in using plant translocations to address global biodiversity loss.
