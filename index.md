The Plant Translocation Network is an international network of researchers, practitioners and policymakers using plant translocations to address biodiversity loss.  We are always looking for new members and new ideas to help improve the use of plant translocations and our understanding of their impacts on our environment and its management.  Our members number more than 100 and include conservationists, foresters, horticulturalists, and others who move plants to try to generate a positive outcome.

For information on the Plant Translocation Network including our objectives and plans, and membership see the links in the top right corner.  Updates will be posted below.
